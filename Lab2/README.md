## Claude 3 Features and New Messages API


The multi-modal capability of Claude 3 allows for the input of not only text but also an image that you can ask questions about.

An example of the new mulimodal capability of the Claude 3 model is shown below with the new Messages API structure. In addition, an example of using Claude 3's vision capabilities in a RAG workflow is shown using Langchain. We also have a best practices guide for improving performance with Claude 3 Vision.
